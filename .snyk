  # Path Traversal in CLI data ingestion scripts
  # These are admin-only CLI tools that:
  # 1. Implement path validation (extension, existence, directory checks)
  # 2. Block sensitive system directories
  # 3. Support allowlist via DATA_INGESTION_ALLOWED_DIR env var
  # 4. Are not exposed to untrusted user input
